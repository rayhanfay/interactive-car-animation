A group project in creating an animated application program that can move freely. This project is built in Java and specifically designed to run in the NetBeans IDE. The goal is to demonstrate animation control and interactivity within a simple application framework.

## Features

- **Interactive Controls**: Users can control the car animation, adjusting its speed, direction, and movement.
- **Free Movement**: Allows the animated car to move freely within the frame.
- **Java-Based**: Uses Java for logic and interactivity, providing a robust and object-oriented framework for animation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rayhanfay/interactive-car-animation.git
    ```

2. Open the project in [NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.apache.org/).
3. Build and run the project directly within NetBeans.

## Usage
