# Interactive Car Animation

A group project in creating an animated application program that can move freely. This project is built in Java and specifically designed to run in the NetBeans IDE. The goal is to demonstrate animation control and interactivity within a simple application framework.

## Features

- **Interactive Controls**: Users can control the car animation, adjusting its speed, direction, and movement.
- **Realistic Animation Effects**: Includes effects for a visually engaging experience.
- **Free Movement**: Allows the animated car to move freely within the frame.
- **Java-Based**: Uses Java for logic and interactivity, providing a robust and object-oriented framework for animation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rayhanfay/interactive-car-animation.git
    ```

2. Open the project in [NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.apache.org/).
3. Build and run the project directly within NetBeans.

## Usage

Once run in NetBeans, users can interact with the car through on-screen controls to change its direction and speed.

## Technologies

- **Java**: Main programming language, handling application logic and interactivity.
- **NetBeans IDE**: Required IDE for building and running the project.
